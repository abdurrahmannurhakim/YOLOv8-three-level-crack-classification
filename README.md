# YOLOv8 for Crack Classification and Image Manipulation with OpenCV üõ†Ô∏è

This project leverages **YOLOv8** for the classification of different types of cracks (hairline, structural, spalling) on surfaces. Additionally, it uses **OpenCV** for image manipulation, including adding custom text to the images.

## Features
- **Crack Classification**: Classifies cracks into three categories:
  1. **Hairline Cracks**
  2. **Structural Cracks**
  3. **Spalling Cracks**
  
- **Image Manipulation**: The software uses **OpenCV** to:
  - Overlay text onto the detected cracks
  - Highlight the areas of interest
  
- **Real-time Processing**: Enables real-time detection and classification of cracks in images.

## Technologies Used
- **YOLOv8** for crack detection and classification
- **OpenCV** for image processing and text manipulation
- **Python** for the backend logic and control
